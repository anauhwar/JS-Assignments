    <p><b>1) Script</b>A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes</p>

    <p><b>2) Number</b>JavaScript has only one type of numbers.Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:</p>

    <p><b>3) Booleans</b>Booleans can only have two values: true or false.</p>

    <p><b>4) Arrays</b>JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.Array items are separated by commas.The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names)</p>

    <p><b>5) Objects</b>JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}. Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.</p>

    <p><b>6) Null</b>In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.You can empty an object by setting it to null.</p>
